BlueMap is a tool that generates 3d-maps of your Minecraft worlds and displays them in your browser. 
Take a look at [this demo](https://bluecolored.de/bluemap). 
It is really easy to set up - almost plug-and-play - if you use the integrated web-server *(optional)*.

The Sponge/Spigot-Plugin automatically updates your map as soon as something changes in your world, 
as well as rendering newly generated terrain and managing the render-tasks.

Some features and some blocks are still missing. Especially some tile-entities will not render correctly/at all. 
[Here](https://github.com/orgs/BlueMap-Minecraft/projects/2) is a list of what is planned for 
future releases.
